i count on your leadership .
we cannot allow the consumer to be misled by the food additive thrombin .

mr president , a friend who knows I was in gaza just three days ago challenges me .

i believe that we have sent out the right message .
the next item is the council and commission statements on the stockholm action plan .
in 2010 , foreign policy will , as in previous years , be a tricky issue .

we reassert their right to defend themselves and to remain themselves .
unfortunately , president barroso was accused of not being democratically elected and of bullying the irish into submission .
that would represent a clear and unambiguous signal .
thank you very much .
we will do it together .
we will also be happy to have a solution that is fair to us .
this year , 2009 , is a fateful year for european cooperation .

some of you have asked ,what is the point of all this ?

energy efficiency is vitally important as regards environmental sustainability and as regards conserving finite resources .
i believe that each body has its own area of work .

thank you very much .
this will undoubtedly be one of the central objectives of the informal meeting of the european council on thursday 
the concern is for next winter .
i would urge that more attention be paid to issues that directly affect the daily lives of citizens .
indeed , prior to our meeting , there appeared to be a wide divergence of views .
negotiations , which began last year , are currently underway with russia .
research in the construction sector is moving towards a greener approach to building .
the prime minister's resignation , the dissolution of parliament , early elections in short , democracy .
this is an important point that the eu will continue to emphasise to all of the relevant dialogue partners .

there are two options open to us .
i will do my utmost to have the agreement of the contracting parties that we can fully inform you .

we have to bring that together .
nl I wish to raise a point of order based on article 168 2 .
dcm is one of these substances and must be taken out of circulation .

mr president , I will try to answer my fellow members .

these gaps in the gas grid must be closed , urgently .
my apologies for tabling it now .
these approaches together encourage reform within individual countries , and reinforce regional cooperation .
for years , the reports on turkey's progress have consisted of one long list of problems .
the reality of daily life shows that much progress remains to be made in the member states .
it is hard to believe that romania will be able to achieve this target by 20its potential is far greater .
it is quite intolerable that the council should walk out of this debate .
without them , there would be no euro .
our thoughts and our prayers are with them .
you have run out of time .
i hope that this accident will not have any impact on the outcome of the elections .
regional policy is the primary source of european investment in the real economy .
so , today , mr sarkozy is calling for an opt out from employment policies .
the way things are going in italy makes that country very vulnerable in its democracy .
it is a new start , as mrs malmström said .
eu red tape is strangling our entrepreneurs and the carbon tax scam is plunging millions into deadly fuel poverty .
these measures must be supported by legislative proposals which also guarantee the financial allocations .
the debate will continue until 11.00 .
the votes of the unionist meps today adds further to this shame .
it has to show decisiveness at the political level .
it will allow the eu to exert a real influence in the international arena .
this is a really important point .
an alarming number of member states have high levels of national debt .
however , unlike swift , there were definitely good reasons for this postponement .
financial imbalances are due to issues surrounding budgets and the balance of payments .
interconnection of business registers 
unfortunately , there are numerous current incidences of this within the eu too .
the commission's proposal to set some maximum tariffs is the matter we are discussing now .
we therefore reject the oral amendment .
we will support proposals of this kind , but we will fight every attempt to destroy regional policy .
thank you very much , mr schulz .
meanwhile , outrageous human rights abuses continue unabated as juveniles and homosexuals are executed routinely .
i am speaking first now , but really to make a point to the presidency .
reread parliament's resolution and immediately opt for an unconditional 30 % .
to achieve this , we must continue to work on the development of our strategic partnership .
it is right to fight for freedom and values for all , not big jobs for the lucky few .
finally , I think that the timetable is very important .
written statements rule 149 
closure of the sitting
i am not going to make hypothetical statements about hypothetical referendums .
they are already under represented in the iraqi parliament and this is certain to lead to more tension and instability .
rise in food prices vote 
i am actually from an electoral constituency where 99 % of the electorate are catholic .
the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under rule 149 8 
it would therefore be inconsistent with our earlier positions to give consent without further ado .
let me give you just a few examples .
the commission's concerns have been put forcefully to the canadian authorities for quite some time now .
yes , this means overhauling the lisbon strategy after 20let me say that I have been shocked by the scale of unethical behaviour that we have seen .
this will ultimately be the most effective way of improving safety for all passengers .
the united states administration tells us that is not the case .
harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products debate 
sometimes it can be proven that they prefer to attend party conferences .
the withdrawal of support for the petition by the petitioner is being remedied .
this accelerated procedureviolatesnot only the spirit , but also the letter , of the treaties .
we need to do something about this .
more than half of this number , 22 million , are romanians .
it is hard to be sure .
providing incentives may help to achieve this goal .
i would like to add my voice to those who consider this field to be very important .
having no objections to present , I voted in favour of the approval of this decision .
that is why cross border action is urgently required .
our paths diverge completely on the lisbon treaty , mr barroso .
i think it would be important to consider whether we should pursue that .
written declarations included in the register rule 116 see minutes
el thank you , commissioner , for your reply .
i think we ought to have the courtesy to ask our people , our voters , whether they approve .
i sincerely hope the promise of an early autumn referendum will mean early october at the very latest .
parliament , however , rejected financing by these funds for polluting lignite power plants .
investment by smes is one of the key factors in the keenly awaited recovery .
all of us here are well paid and can afford to give .
in this connection , let me remind you of previous failures by humanity on this front .
all asylum seekers and all minors have already been transferred to appropriate centres .
i could say that I think you and your two colleagues will probably owe me lunch after this .
this is not a necessary cost given the current situation .
mr president , I noted carefully what the rapporteur said .
in addition to the original pse group amendment , mr swoboda tabled putting the wordsources.
i only wanted to .
precisely these categories of expenses should not be increased during the crisis .
once again , we have ascertained that europe's strength lies in concerted action .
this is the conclusion reached in mr monti's report , which was submitted two days ago .
lv thank you , mr president .
the regulation of derivatives will create new european market infrastructures .
things have gone horribly , horribly wrong .
we will now suspend the sitting .
the arctic also presents itself as a unique opportunity for multinational cooperation .
integration of territorial cohesion in the future development of all community policies 
we need a peer review system we need monitoring mechanisms .
we must ensure the financing of key infrastructure projects and reject the renationalisation of regional policy .
a europe that is whole , a europe that is free and a europe that is at peace .
we are talking here today about human rights and who is breaching them .
i would simply like to mention one or two cases that are not addressed very often .
the head of the agency gave satisfactory answers on this matter during the committee hearings .
applause 
written statements rule 142 
it is absolutely paramount to focus this support in the areas most affected by land abandonment .
i talked with him for an hour just before he left for the united states to meet president obama .
unfortunately , copenhagen brought absolutely no progress on this matter .
within this framework , simplifications could be made and distinctions drawn .
that is true outside the eurozone as well as inside it .
can we convert that into a grant ?
that offers opportunities , but must be handled with great care .
my second question is the following .
naturally , you must check the law and the legislation what is the alternative ?
we are employing energy ever more rationally .
it is on the list of terrorist organisations and it is difficult to take action against it .
these are the main issues and they cover various directions where the commission acts to reduce poverty .
in addition , the demands of consumers regarding the quality of food are increasing .
before the vote 
a party put forward a candidate before the elections .
such aid is particularly important in the context of developing trust and reconstructing the country .
this treaty gives us new objectives .
i also want to warn against any thoughts about subsuming development policy as part of our foreign policy .
surely the way in which the authorities are responding to this undermines this freedom .
we do not agree with the fingerprinting of children of 14 years of age .
that is the task that this strategy must allow us to fulfil .
what action can be expected ?
amendment of the interinstitutional agreement of 17 may 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management 
the sitting was opened at 09 05 
that must not happen , because we would then be rewarding bad policy with a bonus .
in addition , it has brought about an increase in the range of services being offered .
one has to recognise the specificity of the region within the eastern partnership and approach that specificity as such .
we represent half a billion inhabitants of this continent a considerable responsibility .
this will then be reflected in the long term by stability and growth .
parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment 
τhe next item is voting time .
i voted in favour of the european parliament resolution on action against cancer european partnership .
it is our credibility that is at stake here .
it is timely and welcome in particular for three reasons .
we want a decision quickly .
that is the new mathematical formula of the barroso commission .
action plan on urban mobility 
this is not acceptable in a democracy . it has to stop .
these initiatives were appreciated but inadequate .
castro's dictatorial rule is a disgrace to the idea of democratic socialism .
coordinated regulatory intervention is required in order to protect the common currency against speculation .
our neighbours are found around the mediterranean sea and in eastern europe .
full cooperation with the hague tribunal is not enough because it needs to be brought to a successful end .
it is estimated that cattle rearing is responsible for 80 % of illegal deforestation .
i find this voluntary arrangement to buy back milk quotas counterproductive .
i suspect it probably will be and I think it can actually be put to very good use .
thank you , mrs bowles .
despite the rebuffs , we need to seek political dialogue .
the vote will take place tomorrow , thursday 2 april 200equal treatment of persons irrespective of religion or belief , disability , age or sexual orientation debate

i deplore the negative vote of the epp and ecr groups .
this is not democracy , this is despotism .
madam president , I come with two questions for the commissioner . one what is culture ?
the violence must stop .
parliament has set out numerous questions in writing to the commission and the council .
naturally , I also wish to personally express my support for all the families affected by these tragic events .
i now turn to the issue of encouraging member state cooperation while permitting external providers .
these cannot be seen as a consolation .
progress in the negotiations remains slow .
i wanted to show that we can do even better .
it has helped the democratisation and modernisation process in turkey .
i think that we should be very careful not to hold up the benefits .
they like honest foods and they like honest politicians .

rapporteur . madam president , I very much welcome the commissioner's positive response .
we will have modern and up to date regulations in an area where development is very rapid .
for this reason , the fdp in the european parliament abstained from voting .
only then will history give us a standing ovation .
i thank them and their entire team for their excellent cooperation , despite some internal political difficulties .
also this week , an international conference entitledeurope without barrierstook place .
you are invited to attend .
regional variation must therefore be taken into consideration and catered for in the post cap 20in this report we describe the effects of the common agricultural policy post 20my group will support this .
the top priority for the coming weeks must be to work together to turn our intentions into reality .
key objectives for the conference of the parties to the cites debate 
we also need to take into account the problems of the dairy farmers in austria and the alpine region .
democracy is vital , of course .
in that regard I am entirely behind the commission's approach .
adequate technical and logistical means are necessary in order for the work to be carried out quickly and efficiently .
and the name of one of the murderers is cesare battisti .
each member state's foreign relations must be subject to democratic control .
the previous criteria for support of these areas must be modified so that they reflect actually existing handicaps .
against this background , I am calling for higher safety standards on the railways .
as for the second question I just want to underline that lorries have nothing to do with tax havens .
why should reputable businesses suffer at the hands of unfair competitors who profit when consumers are not compensated ?
the same applies to the simplifying provisions .
we fully recognise the growing strategic importance of the arctic region .
it is pleasing to see that a number of amendments that tended to contaminate this text have been withdrawn .
but to achieve these things europe must marshal consensus , and the uk must be part of it .
nationalist rhetoric is still very present , creating unnecessary political tensions .
it has done nothing .
protectionism is like a dose of cocaine for an economy .
dichloromethanes will come off the market for non industrial use .
we talk about costs .
firstly , then , we need to invest in something that will keep demand high .
fourth , on the question of israel there are two important issues following the elections .
croatia handed over all its wanted war criminals years ago .
i think there is always a reason to sit with us and to listen to the discussions .
it will not hurt for once .
it is actually a net creditor , unlike most latin american countries .
the solution to this situation is obviously not for us to discontinue the european union's common agricultural policy .
sk the hungarian representatives are misleading european public opinion with many untruths .
i would like to highlight a few key issues .
the last neeaps arrived at the commission in june 200many of them confirmed that they found the cross sectoral effort needed to prepare them very useful .
the law also makes it hard to justify the international community's massive military and financial assistance to afghanistan .
if we are talking about further development of the technology , then this must be in all areas .
what about the conflict of interest in the gas sector in russia , the kremlin's influence on gazprom ?
it is also full of examples of so called minority opinions ultimately proving to be correct .
our group therefore voted against .
these businesses will have to keep supporting documents clearly showing transactions carried out and their own financial situation .
it is therefore simply a matter of getting started .
if we achieve all of this , then russia will take us seriously and we will co exist well .
that , you see , is a fundamental part of the whole blue card system .
this is not easy , but I would like to draw your attention to a number of successes .
the rules must be made clearer , information more accessible , the administrative burden lighter and procedures more transparent .
these resolutions are binding for eu member states under international law .
now we shall be conducting an election campaign where things are being shifted to brussels again .
we should not react negatively to the wordmarket.
president in office of the council . let me underline that it is not a lack of political will .
there is a certain contradiction here .
moreover , an a class tyre is more cost effective in the long run .
at the same time , I would like to raise two matters .
extending europe's ambitions to the entire planet would result in global warming of 4 degrees .
let us also respect those not in agreement .
that is no justification or explanation for this kind of censorship .

the court has already ruled on this matter and I firmly believe that very little scope remains here .
we have increased the workforce by 280 international personnel .

these measures will allow us to create around 7 million jobs across europe by 20in the case of ets sectors , financing mechanisms are required for the low carbon economy .
lastly , acta must not compromise access to generic medicines .
under pressure from the european parliament , the agreement which we have already concluded is coming up for review .
who are our main strategic partners in the world ?
however , I want to focus on the excellent report that maria martens has produced .
home childcare must not be detrimental to public childcare services .
finally , I also have concerns with the role of drug companies in influencing doctorsprescription habits .
report pervenche berès
instead , we should ensure that we have only one seat .
we should not exclude this from the discussion right at the outset .
however , we must also learn lessons from this tragedy .
things have gradually improved , with the adoption of qualitative methodologies resulting from care staff receiving specialist training .
a democratic and firmly european ukraine is key to a democratic , reliable and law abiding russia .
the negotiations with iran must be transparent in all aspects .
the spanish presidency is right to emphasise this .
this is what the swedish state can look at and that is indeed what we are doing .
the belgian rail network alone , with its 3 400 kilometres , is larger than that .
this situation is simply unsustainable .
let me begin with trade , because quite a lot of the different contributions focused on that .
nevertheless foods must be included in this regulation , because otherwise .
let me underline two very important milestones along this road .
more than 60 % of all fish consumed in europe today is imported .
this will further increase the gap between the eu15 and the 12 new member states .
i do not regard that as justified if you compare it with the economic consequences of this crisis .
it merely serves to expose the eu's arrogant disregard for democratic opinion .
there is a group there which , by international standards , is classified as far right .
in my opinion , this is not what mr vatanen's report promises .
the rapporteur might want to bear this in mind .
gender equality and women's rights stem from human rights .
the haemorrhage of jobs must be stopped .
this help can come from us in different shapes and forms .
but that is not about kick starting economic growth in abusiness as usualdirection .
the possibility of using tax revenue to clear the deficit has not been totally excluded .
i believe that this is a good thing , which makes holding the double referendum worthwhile .
are we also considering , within the southern corridor , the white stream caspian georgia black sea ukraine romania project ?
it is , of course , possible to provide you with the necessary details if you are interested .
as members know , we are pursuing a range of bilateral agreements in conjunction with this .
thirdly , I am particularly pleased that the in kind contributions are now recognised as eligible expenditure .
i would like to highlight a few areas in which we need to continue to work .
an ad hocvulnerability flexinstrument will mobilise eur 500 million from the european development fund .
i am all for nuclear safety and all for nuclear energy .
the debate is closed .
remember , as honourable members know , it does not exist at all at the moment .
one person in four will experience some form of mental health disorder at least once in their lives .
the european maritime sector is facing an ever growing shortage of qualified seafarers .
i am thinking in particular of what we can do to achieve a more sustainable transport system .
to say that the european model completely failed is totally wrong .
i would like to begin by thanking mr salafranca for his excellent report .
this is very important .
we must ensure that the laws remain balanced and feasible .
i myself am a beneficiary of cross border health care .
children of users and , in particular , of farmers , are also affected .
however , economic depression is not a time for moral depression .
president obama has already rightly emphasised this point .
last weekend was a triumph for communication .
this should be a warning to countries outside the eurozone .
furthermore , the amendment suggests that a unilateral european form of such a tax should be considered .
jobbik believes that it is possible to rid political life of corruption .
those who want to see a better europe should vote against this resolution .
now , however , we all know that it will cost european taxpayers a great deal .
it is not a case of us asking for money for ourselves , as alleged by the press .
let me say quite clearly that we are not against financial support .
i look forward to hearing further from commissioner barnier .
last but not least , there is definitely the issue of interconnection .
therefore , there are two issues .
for that reason , the commission cannot accept amendments 4 , 5 , 21 , 23 and in addition we can positively consider the second part of the amendment regarding the derogations on distance .
the list of the greatest powers is becoming increasingly limited to germany and , at best , france .
this is exactly the opposite to what the commission and the council are proposing .
applause 
we are uniquely placed because of what we have achieved in our union .
these are nanomaterials obtained withtop downtechnology and the use of high energy attrition .

in 2008 , by far the most common allegation I examined was lack of transparency in the eu administration .
this is the situation we are in at the moment .
the vertical divisions in society and the domination of tribal loyalties over personal judgment would make that impossible .
laughter 
i therefore very much welcome this resolution and parliament's strong support for sepa .
thank you for being here , mr van rompuy .
the second point is that the european union ambassador will manage commission funds in future .
of course , we also condemn the coup d état and any attempt to seize power by undemocratic means .
closure of the sitting
in the meantime , these difficulties have been overcome and there are no technical reasons which would prevent harmonisation .
that is not right , either .
the president of the commission is a man , as are almost 70 % of the commissioners .
obviously , there are matters which also concern the summit under way today here in brussels .
unfortunately , not all consumers are aware of this .
the macro financial assistance programme sets out to complement other financing from the union .
that is why I voted for this report .
council , let us step back .

it has instilled fear in people .

i would ask you to rise from your seats in silent remembrance .
however , this success has not to date been transferred to the community context .
i look forward with personal interest to your vote tomorrow .
we need to be aware that every euro we spend comes from the taxpayer .
i would have to do so at least twice a week .
quite the opposite .
finally , I would also like to say that this cannot be the end of the line just yet .
in 2008 , the commission contributed an opinion to the negotiations on the review of the ombudsman's statute .
it has not been thought through .
here I would like to reply by saying that the commission has already actively committed itself .
thank you .
i think it is also absolutely right that you raise the importance of being visible on the ground .
texts of agreements forwarded by the council see minutes
where should we place our emphasis ?
we were in agreement on every single case .
there is certainly much which needs to be improved .
in its first year , 20 of the 27 member states have signed this convention .
there cannot be an agreement unless there is funding tailored to developing countries .
de mr president , let me briefly address two issues .
may I wish you every success in your work and bon courage .
that is why turkey should be welcomed into the eu fold .
the czech prime minister , jan fischer , was also with us and we tried to asses this situation .
this is all the more significant because of the current economic crisis .
eventually , only the top 10 % to 20 % of products per category can be awarded the ecolabel .
the president of the european council is not yet accounted for in the budget .
i hope that the commission will take this request by the european parliament on board .
the defence procurement directive will satisfy these concerns .
that has been a great pleasure .
they have failed resoundingly .
it is also possible that this example could encourage the other un countries to take the same action .
millions of people are freezing and factories are being shut .
we have had to deal with that .
these are very important attributes in the times we live in .
the fall in the prices of milk and dairy products primarily affects farms with low incomes .
thank you very much , and I look forward to the answer .
this does have some consequences in terms of the adaptation of our industry .

that is very important .
the debate is closed .
we now need to think about how we can re engage a political process .
we are aware of the serious effects that it has caused in the world and in the european union .
parliament made all the running it made all the compromise proposals .
as far as I know , though , commissioner , the commission is independent of the member states .
the aim is the step by step liberalisation of trade between the eu and the partner regions or individual states .
in writing . pt I voted against this joint motion for a resolution .

the commission extends its condolences to the families of the victims , in particular .
i too would like to congratulate mr de grandes pascual .
this is the context of the discussion about the new policy instrument that is being held here .
please convey this , to ensure that my work is not hindered and that I receive the answers requested .
this is neither socially nor environmentally minded .
we also have a request with regard to the eu .
the financial crisis has had an impact on transport policy .
we should assess ukrainian politicians by what they do , and not by whatever declarations they might have made .
if you fail there , you will fail everywhere .
the top line is good news prices are improving .

this is where the problem lies .

electronic customs and trade vote 
although solutions are normally based on compromise , in this instance , compromises may not be possible .
in writing . hu madam president , ladies and gentlemen .
when I received the report , I began to read it with great enthusiasm .
the same fate that met iceland , which is not part of the eu , would have awaited ireland .
fourthly , national governments must take on a pioneering role in the development of energy efficient solutions .

applause 
the vote will take place tomorrow .
you have exceeded your speaking time by more than half .
in my view , this is an anticlimax .
so I really feel very sorry that this delegation visit could not take place .
the commission and the council , of course , have two strong arguments for a reappraisal .
that is what we need to see for the europe 2020 agenda .
i deplore that innocent civilians are used as human shields .
in any case , believe me that I will do everything in my power to ensure this .
the statistics for my country , greece , are tragic .
but , nevertheless , that is the reality .
it is not enough to offer minority rights in the form of purely folkloristic performances for foreign tourists .
adjournment of the session
it is regrettable that baroness ashton has just rejected that idea once more .
i would have preferred to see this done at european level from the word go .
according to the government in manila , abu sayyaf is collaborating with al qaida .
because europe is not yet capable of putting forward his vision , ideals and knowledge .
the company's good reputation may be lost as a result of its involvement in human or drugs trafficking .
the european parliament is actively involved in these debates .
many of the causes lie elsewhere .
we need to achieve cost reality here to really bring about a situation where market economic instruments regulate traffic .
we cannot continue discussion on this matter indefinitely .
madam president , I voted against the proposal , mainly because I come from the united kingdom .
kosovo is not an exception .
however , this is not a problem which is specific to italy .
pl I could not support the resolution , although it is extremely important for the european economy .
the health of the latter depends on the quality of the produce of the former .
there is a clear disparity between the seriousness of what happened in azerbaijan compared .
this is because the choice of us president matters to europeans .
the progress of certain projects of vital interest to the european union's development also depends on energy security .
we should also look to a positive side of the agenda that we also gain a technological advantage .
i was pleased to hear both deputy prime minister vondra and president barroso speak about targets .
madam president , energy policy and foreign policy are inextricably interlinked now more than ever .
i think it is decades since we experienced a situation like the one we are seeing today .
the debate is closed .
applause 
this morning , I chanced upon a website of a government organisation called joint task force guantánamo .
this is a major achievement .
this fragmentation makes visibility suffer .
this is our intention .
this measure will lead to a gross violation of personal privacy .
we therefore wish mr al debaqbasi and his colleagues a fruitful stay with us .
i have a specific proposal we will reach this point in the second part of the vote .
we must not forget the citizen and consumer in our recovery strategy .
this is the sad paradox I wanted to share with all of you this afternoon .
it is true that the european social fund has technically been the main source of funding so far .
who will manage the new technology ?
we should all reflect on that .
the union shall take measures to ensure coordination of the employment policies . 
an increased contribution by the member states is desirable .
what purpose does it serve in finding a long term solution ?
in other words , we absolutely must avoid the mistakes of the lisbon strategy .
having noted the quality of the report , I supported it with my vote .
we need strong , improved coordination of our international , as well as our european , economic policy .
if necessary there will be fact finding visits in situ to establish facts or indeed to seek a solution .
in reforming the cap , we must not forget the principles of integration , solidarity and community .
the presidency will continue to take forward the negotiations .
we are lobbying for support for the nuclear weapons convention and the hiroshima nagasaki protocol , because disarmament is possible .
that concludes this item .
it is true that today the european union faces new and serious challenges .
the few jobs which may be on offer depend on the goodwill of the parties .
there has been a 95 % reduction in consumption of ods compared with the baselines set .
firstly , I think that treating healthcare exclusively as a marketable service is a mistake .
de thank you , madam president .
i am actively looking at whether we can provide additional funding in all of these areas .
at this one , a very clear issue is going to be at stake .
it could , by itself , be the biggest help for businesses in the european union .
it is mainly the universities which will benefit from this money and carry out the research .
europol is an agency which must be controlled because it benefits from this agreement .
europe cannot stand still and remain silent in the face of this conflict .
it is up to ukraine to choose the model it wants to adopt .
however , certain essential issues have been relegated to secondary status .
i will not stand for that .
approval of the new allocation of the responsibilities of vice president of the commission jacques barrot vote 
what type of growth ?
after this disappointment , it is important to regain the initiative .
discharge 2005 european network and information security agency vote 
it is a means to improve the working of the european union .
we were concerned about the timetable and scope of application of the future initiatives on procedural rights .
we also oppose the establishment of flexibility mechanisms .
what is more , a strategic vision is being developed that is almost entirely focused on the member states .
it should be further developed and expanded into an effective protection instrument by the eu .
we want it to cover the debate on pluralism in italy and in europe .
the wordcreation.
the eu must invest more in the diversification of energy supply sources .
with a good administrative system there is a clear division of responsibility .
we need to act , but fighting this alone will not work .
this reduces the risk of error and the costs of control .
the sitting was closed at 12 midnight 
it is unacceptable to give eu funds to third countries without any established indicators .
the population has low life expectancy , low levels of education and literacy and high demographic growth .
i do not get the impression that we are on such a path .
the european union is facing , once again , a crisis with its supply of natural gas .
the court's chief prosecutor , luis moreno ocampo , has skilfully helped the court to strengthen its impartiality globally .
their quality of life is also deteriorating .
perhaps you could tell us more about this .
this gives us the opportunity to identify positive and less positive experiences of the implementation of the regulation .
where is the deputy secretary general , since he is not at this debate ?
the eu will continue to provide considerable political , technical and financial support to georgia .
the responsibility for the failure therefore lies fairly and squarely with the council .
i want to know if any assessment has been made .
the commissioner said that you need to be realistic in the commission .
and innovativeness is the key to competitiveness and growth of the european economy .
it is essential that eulex cooperates well with the parties concerned in kosovo .
they did not kill anyone .
we agreed on the priorities very quickly and together managed to introduce rational elements and points of departure .
we are right to go for an ambitious trade agreement .
as regards croatia's imminent eu accession , it is regrettable that border disputes with slovenia remain outstanding .
read it I do not have the time to read it out .
the debate is closed .
we cannot regulate prices indefinitely , as this affects innovation and may even affect competitiveness .
this is a compromise to which the council has already given its approval .
however , the region does not deserve this .
to run such an operation , smes are de facto forced to found a company in the target country .
i do not see any sign of this progress .
global warming is one of the most complicated issues which the whole planet is facing .
in any case , commissioner , it is not competition that is at stake here .
b7 0013 / 2010 b7 0014 / 2010 b7 0202 / 2010 b7 0203 / 2010 .
i particularly believe that the european union must treat this situation seriously and diplomatically .
flexibility and pragmatism have therefore been necessary when apportioning the governance incentive fund .
the strength of the eu lies in its open borders and free trade .
the sitting was closed at 4.20 p.m. 
i am also indebted to the commissioner and to the services of the commission .
we tried that and the banks are still not lending .
the european job mobility action plan 2007 2010 
we need to remember this resolution and parliament's position .
first of all , it seems rather questionable as to whether the timeframe was sufficient .
i welcome this .
this is also a political issue .

however , we are pleased to vote with anybody , if we agree with what they propose .
it is allowing a flood of imports from developing economies with wage rates a fraction of those in europe .
i completely agree on the three reasons for the situation .
we are told that farmers in ireland did well and that is true .
the idea here is precisely to find common forward looking solutions at an eu level .
however , it has now reached the limits of what it can do .
such criteria may assist in building a certain image or providing a certain level of service .
but I think there are some specific things , to be more concrete , that we can do .
finally , I would like to add my voice in calling for the release of the judge .
i think it is a logical thing also vis à vis the citizens .
i saw what happened when democracy fails .
you will remember how we clashed over your interpretation of this house's rules of procedure .
the smallest agencies have more difficulty in following the onerous procedures imposed by eu legislation .
this is , however , a strategic question , in which the council's committed support is indispensable .
i would still like to believe in an about turn by europe .
the commission has proposed exactly the same solution for labelling products in which thrombin is used as a glue .
let us not forget , however , that the statistics were also european .
we need a humane asylum and immigration policy .
i believe that we have many points of view in common .
we have one result in south korea .

it would be foolish of us not to do so .
but this planet has finite resources .
it is therefore a topic that must be tackled on different fronts .

the new treaty of lisbon provides a legal basis for such action .
as it stands , there is a gap in consumer protection where air passengers are concerned .
the facts show clear violation of not only minority but also basic human rights .
another stage is being completed , and further chapters must be tackled or completed without delay .
this is a political reality .
i should like to say a couple of things about my report on vessel traffic monitoring .

the cost of producing the milk is higher than the price for which it is sold .
we have to turn this situation around and the social agenda should help achieve that .
scarcely a week passes without media reports of further suicide attacks .
it increased the money supply and ensured that the lending volume increased significantly .
the progress in the development of these guidelines is , so far , very encouraging .
we , parliament , have long been fighting for more rights particularly in the field of agriculture .
i would like to thank parliament for treating the commission's proposals for revamping the fund with such speed .
from this perspective , unfortunately , there is nothing new in your programme .
we now pay out funds based on simple technical requirements .
quotas have increased , while production has fallen .
therefore , I come with high expectations of how democracy will be handled in this parliament .
bring in a cease fire !
mr president , I will conclude .
i think that we should focus on them .
the tbc and nabucco projects are affecting the political stability of our neighbours .
we must give priority to the way in which our homes are designed .
these relate directly to the health of our children , who play with the toys that we buy them .
tomorrow in my constituency of london , we celebrate the anniversary of the 7 / 7 bombing .
our focus must be on the people themselves .
anyone violating it also violates international law and that is something this house really cannot accept .
it is interesting how we often talk about european common values and solidarity with the citizens .
do not reject it .
2009 was a good year for the candidate country of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia fyrom .
if parliament were to approve this amendment , we would be in breach of article 2accordingly , it is declared to be inadmissible .
everything has a positive side too , however .
we have a saying in czech thathe who gives quickly gives twice.
a convincing european strategy to create a stronger europe should take leadership on global level .
the reason for my abstention is not complicated .
compromises were hard fought , and I think we have made a step forward on the common visa policy .
please could you answer this ?
it is also a question of who the commissioners are and which portfolios they have .
i agree with the first speech .
it has a moral and political dimension , but also a security and legal dimension .
we have lost years .
please inform the technical service .

a full accident prevention policy is required for the facilities in which toxic substances are treated or stored .

i can give you concrete examples .
i would urge him to revise his line .
there is now a need and a use for such people .

it is beyond doubt that minimising risks to human health and environmental protection take priority .
in this context , I welcome the council's initiative to set up an informal eu nato high level group .
the council has announced that it will not be making a statement .
but reaching an agreement requires convergence on the following essential building blocks .
four years to see this kind of proposal maturing is not too long .
yes , the situation is complex .
today , we are witnessing in latin america a dangerous regression into socialist dictatorship and oppression .

i very much welcome the legislation that has been introduced in ireland , italy and other countries .
they then set out bold objectives and try to convince people that everything really will be better this time .
nonetheless , there is a broad consensus that it should be done now .
the only thing is that the votes will be held on 5 and 6 may .
there is going to be an exhibition on this subject in brussels .
today , however , the commission is proposing to abolish the existing exemption for the sale of new vehicles .

mr president , I agree with mr jarzembowski when he says that mobility is essential to society .
we shall then have comparable reduction obligations which will mean that the problem of competitiveness will not exist .
you spoke about the responsibility of member states .
that is the point of my speech .
are we on the side of china or tiananmen square ?
and oh don't you know ,
the draft compromise before us today would strengthen this high level of protection through several provisions .
of course we do .
it would certainly have resulted in a rejection .
that is our development challenge as a parliament .
the problems of the airline companies will require a different solution , of course .
what is needed is that good will .
so we have to involve the countries of asia .
it is not just for the benefit of european producers that we should look at this issue .
the other concern is transfer pricing .
rating agencies know that they will not get the work if they question the solvency of their clients .
another important factor is that their accession would create a precedent .
these are not new subjects .

the programme of our activities for 2009 is very substantial about nine sectoral ministerial conferences are scheduled .
this is the scenario in which our major businesses are forced to operate .
as I have said , it is not in the interests of the workers .
we must take these decisions in a way that is democratic , open and allows transparency .
it should be constructed within the member states and the community institutions .
i welcome the general support parliament has given to our approach to multilingualism .
in these circumstances , it is usually micro enterprises and young entrepreneurs that suffer the most .

this should all be found in this resolution .

i will not do this now because I believe that we cannot simply ignore what happened today .
debate on cases of breaches of human rights , democracy and the rule of law debate 
the crucial thing is actually to also generate awareness of these tourism products .
failure to do this would lead to the loss of a rich cultural heritage .
in other words , we are dealing with a common neighbourhood .
it is therefore hypocritical of us to say that we have no evidence .
as the european union , we can help these countries here .
we must leave our fears behind .
hence , we had to accomplish our discussion and texts in an extremely short period of time .

it is just that , at present , they are paid for from national budgets .
administrative and structural barriers must be removed .
again I would like to thank parliament for its strong support for developing a european energy policy .
it does not call for any genuine guarantee of the protection of these data or opportunities for redress .
the commission will continue to follow this case closely .
and so I ask you what doesnormalisationmean with regard to religious freedom ?
indeed , opening up our borders to foreign competition has not brought any negative consequences for domestic services .

mr president , with regard to the partnership with brazil , the report undoubtedly has some highly positive aspects .
i voted for the annual report on human rights in the world 200this report essentially has two objectives .
action taken by the eu and member states can only support action taken by the producers themselves .

it must be remembered that an excessive deficit procedure anticipates supervision of economic policies in justified cases .
applause 
interjection from the floor 
the commission will continue to analyse the link between food prices and energy prices .
it would be cynical , then , not to take very forceful action .
i really hope that parliament will also take part in this debate .
not so much with the presidency of the council as such , but with the member states .
the single market will never be delivered , and the ertms will never happen .
we have voted in favour of the report .
these statements are downright loathsome , and I take the view that this cannot be without consequences .
the eu strategy for relations with latin america 
we cannot really be saying that we want to preach one thing and do another .
i share the opinion of the commission on setting clear priorities and long term planning .

in 2009 , only eur 37 million were mobilised , out of a possible eur 500 million .
however , this substance represents a group of around a hundred others .
furthermore , no policy can truly function without cross sectoral implementation .

we must have more facts and not fiction , and we certainly should dwell on the facts .
then , of course , there is the economic climate in which we find ourselves these days .

we are pleased that this expires in six monthstime .
the presidency wants to achieve success , and it wants this above all else .
this , in turn , would have adverse effects on food production and the economy .
but the truth is that the euro did protect the countries which share the single currency .
the dramatic images convey one clear message .
it is at the heart of our middle east policy .

it is good that we have had a first rate expert in the field as our rapporteur on this issue .
the eu solidarity fund allows us to act as a community to alleviate misery and suffering .
we are currently developing a shared vision of the future of the economy and the labour market in europe .

the loss of human lives was coupled with the destruction of most civilian infrastructure .
however , there is a large gap when it comes to the means to be used .

thirdly , we are working on a strategy for combating climate change and this is good .

however , I voted against the draft resolution for a number of reasons .
kosovo 
thank you for your attention .
i think that we can go even further in this regard .
the third point is on sharing information .
in this context , we need to take into account what this means for the people's living conditions .
